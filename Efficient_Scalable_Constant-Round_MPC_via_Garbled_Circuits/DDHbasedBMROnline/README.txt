DESCRIPTION

Implementation of the code using key homomorphic PRFs based on DDH in quadratic residues group of a large safe prime.

COMPILATION

Compilation is done using cmake, by executing the following two commands (before executing the commands, delete ???.)

1)cmake CMakeLists.txt
2)make

NOTE: compilation requires SCAPI to be installed in the home directory.

RUNNING

Running is done by executing

"./HomOnlineTest.out <Partynum> <CircuitFile> <InputsFile> <IPFile> <Key> 0"

Partynum is the party number. This number should also match the location of the party's IP in the IP file. For non-local execution, it is possible to use "-1" and the party number is taken as the location in the IP file.

CircuitFile is the file of the circuit. All parties must use the exact same file.

InputsFile contains the inputs for the input wires of the party.

IPFile is the IPs (IPv4) of the parties. The file contains the IPs written row after row, without spaces. The IP of party p should appear at row p+1 (party 0 written on the first row, etc.). All parties must use the exact same file.

Key should be a random secret key.
